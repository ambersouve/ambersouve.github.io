<p> <h2> Education</h2> I was born and raised in a small town in western Maine. I grew up with mostly the 
same people in small school, with a graduating class of 50 people. I graduated fourth in my class after doing a full year 
of college before graduation, and decided to attend UMaine for college. There, I study business and plan to 
become an investment banker. </p>

<p> <h2> Home Life</h2> I grew up in a family of four. It was just my parents, my sister, and I. My sister graduated 
when she was only 16 and moved out shortly after. Then it  was as though I was an only child. My mother is a nurse at our 
local health clinic, and my father is self employed. My sister is now a medical assistant and married, starting a family of
her own. </p>

<p> <h2> Future Goals</h2> After college, I would like to work for a while, and build my career. I would like to get 
married early on, and start a family as well. Family is very important to me and I would like one of my own. I want to
live "The American Dream". A nice house, a loving husband, and three or so loving children. </p>
