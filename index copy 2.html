<p> <h2> Traze</h2> Traze is my nine year old, fox red, Labrador Retriever. I got him when I was nine years old, and he has
been my best friend ever since. He is the most loyal, loving, snuggly dog I've ever had, and we do EVERYTHING together. 
He loves going for car rides and walks, as well as just hanging out at home watching Gossip Girl with me. I trained him
myself, and he has taught me so much about unconditional love. </p>

<p> <h2> Ceramics</h2> One of my few hobbies is ceramics. I did ceramics in school from grade six to twelve, and when I
ran out of classes to take, I did it as an independant study. It was something I got pretty good at and enjoyed. I have 
always been pretty artistic but I had never found something that I enjoyed so much. </p>

<p> <h2> Hair and Makeup</h2> Another hobby of mine is doing peoples' hair and makeup. I am better at doing it on myself, but 
I do it for close friends or family members who need me to. I have always been good at working with my hands, and like I said before, I 
am pretty artistic.
